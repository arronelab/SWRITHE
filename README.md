## FAQs

### How do I upload my own PDB file?
  * On the left of the colab window will be a taskbard with four icons. Click the bottom icon which looks like a folder. This will open a small window on the left titled Files. Under the title are four more icons, click the first of these, which looks like a little file with an upwards arrow. Once you have selected and uploaded your file, its filepath will be */content/{your_file}.pdb*
  **Note:** Your uploaded file, and any subsequent writhe files relating to it, will only be available for the duration of your active Colab session. Be sure to download anything you don't want to lose.
